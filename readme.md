My very simple site

### Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [roots](http://roots.cx) are installed
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `roots watch`

### Deploying
run `sh deploy.sh` in dev branch. Will need to commit all your changes first from that branch to work
